  aires : "You don't have to create everything alone, Aries. Life isn't an individual sport. To live life fully, you must participate. Often this involves interacting with other people. This is an exercise in confidence. Do you want to be with us - yes or no? Regardless of your answer, outside events will lead you in a direction that you can neither predict nor imagine."
  taurus : "When we have found our path, we naturally want to start to walk down it, Taurus. The reverse isn't true despite what you seem to believe. It's quite futile to learn how to walk when you don't know which path to walk upon. This may seem a little obscure to you, and yet it's true. Desire is what creates aptitude, not the reverse."
  gemini : "The astral energy is encouraging you to open up more to your world, culture, and ways of thinking, Gemini. You don't have to go off alone in the desert to reinvent everything. For you, this would be the easy way out, because it would allow you to hide! Develop your curiosity about what exists in this society. Your opinion will carry weight later on."
  virgo : "Your mind is in great turmoil right now, Virgo, so it isn't surprising that you can't pay much attention to anything. It's as though your concept of the world has been inexorably changed and you see your love life and career with new eyes. Even so, you feel compelled to pick up the pieces of the past and save them. The day ahead should help you let go of the old world."
